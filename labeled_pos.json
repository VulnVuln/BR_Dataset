This can lead to el expression injection (something similar to sql injection). \nConsider the following example:\n\nIn message bundle we have message:\nmsg,welcome=Welcome {0} on our home page!\n\nIn JSP we use MessageTag to print this message with user name applied as argument:\n<spring:message code=\"msg,welcome\" arguments=\"${userBean.firstName}\"/>\n\nIf malicious user supplies an el expressions instead of his first name, he can gain access to sensitive data.\nFor example, he can enter ${initParam.someParam} and gain access to init parameters defined in web.xml.\nThrough ${pageContext.servletContext.applicationContext} he can discover server type and some internal server configuration.\nPotentially he can discover some other sensitive data accessible by EL expressions.\nAdditionally EL expressions are not escaped by spring's HtmlUtil.escapeHtml(...).\n\nI think that there should be a way to completely disable EL expression evaluation in MessageTag, because it is not needed when using JSP 2.0 (with builtin el evaluation)."

The CSRF token is required to be unique for each session. But, as this cookie accepts user-agent provided value at login and doesn't clear the cookie at logout, the value of the CSRF token is same across sessions, for the users using the same user-agent.\r\n \r\nThis vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to steal this cookie from the victim's browser, even when there is no active victim session. And then, the value can be used by the attacker to perform the CSRF attack.

By this it is possible to limit the whole thing to\nnot allow loading e.g. /etc/passwd as a stylesheet.\n\nIn 4.4 we should add a solrconfig.xml setting to enable the old behaviour, but disable it by default, if your existing installation requires the files from outside the instance dir which are not available via the URLClassLoader used internally.

        "title": "CVE-2016-1000031 - Apache Commons FileUpload DiskFileItem File Manipulation Remote Code Execution",
        "description": "http://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2016-12\n\nSummary\n\nThere exists a Java Object in the Apache Commons FileUpload library that can be manipulated in such a way that when it is deserialized, it can write or copy files to disk in arbitrary locations. Furthermore, while the Object can be used alone, this new vector can be integrated with ysoserial to upload and execute binaries in a single deserialization call. This may or may not work depending on an application's implementation of the FileUpload library.\n\nBackground\n\nIn late 2015 FoxGlove Security released a write up on using Chris Frohoff\u2019s yososerial tool to gain remote code execution on a variety of commercial products, based on a presentation at AppSec Cali in January, 2015. The ysoserial tool uses \u201cgadgets\u201d in Apache Commons Collections, Groovy, and Spring that do \u201cunexpected\u201d things during deserialization. Specifically, the ysoserial payloads eventually execute Runtime.getRuntime().exec() allowing for remote Java code execution.\n\nThe Apache Commons project maintains a library called \u201cFileUpload\u201d to make \u201cit easy to add robust, high-performance, file upload capability to your servlets and web applications.\u201d One of the classes in the FileUpload library is called \u201cDiskFileItem\u201d. A DiskFileItem is used to handle file uploads. Interestingly, DiskFileItem is serializable and implements custom writeObject() and readObject() functions.\n\nDiskFileItem\u2019s readObject Implementation\n\nHere is the implementation that currently exists at the projects repository tip (as of 1/28/16):\n\n\n632    private void readObject(ObjectInputStream in)\n633            throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {\n634        // read values\n635        in.defaultReadObject();\n636\n637        /* One expected use of serialization is to migrate HTTP sessions\n638         * containing a DiskFileItem between JVMs. Particularly if the JVMs are\n639         * on different machines It is possible that the repository location is\n640         * not valid so validate it.\n641         */\n642        if (repository != null) {\n643            if (repository.isDirectory()) {\n644                // Check path for nulls\n645                if (repository.getPath().contains(\"\\0\")) {\n646                    throw new IOException(format(\n647                            \"The repository [%s] contains a null character\",\n648                            repository.getPath()));\n649                }\n650            } else {\n651                throw new IOException(format(\n652                        \"The repository [%s] is not a directory\",\n653                        repository.getAbsolutePath()));\n654            }\n655        }\n656\n657        OutputStream output = getOutputStream();\n658        if (cachedContent != null) {\n659            output.write(cachedContent);\n660        } else {\n661            FileInputStream input = new FileInputStream(dfosFile);\n662            IOUtils.copy(input, output);\n663            IOUtils.closeQuietly(input);\n664            dfosFile.delete();\n665            dfosFile = null;\n666        }\n667        output.close();\n668\n669        cachedContent = null;\n670    }\nThis is interesting due to the apparent creation of files. However, after analyzing the state of DiskFileItem after serialization it became clear that arbitrary file creation was not supposed to be intended:\n\ndfos (a type of OutputStream) is transient and therefore it is not serialized. dfos is regenerated by the getOutputStream() call above (which also generates the new File to write out to).\nThe \u201crepository\u201d (or directory that the file is written to) has to be valid at the time of serialization in order for successful deserialization to occur.\nIf there is no \u201ccachedContent\u201d then readObject() tries to read in the file from disk.\nThat filename is always generated via getOutputStream.\nSerialized Object Modification\n\nThe rules listed above do not take into account that someone might modify the serialized data before it is deserialized. Three important elements get serialized that we can modify:\n\nThe repository path (aka the directory that the file is read/written from).\nIf there is cachedContent (i.e. data that didn\u2019t get written to the file) then that gets serialized\nIf there is no cachedContent (i.e. all data was written to disk) the full path to the output file exists.\nThe threshold value that controls if \u201ccachedContent\u201d is written to disk or not.\nModifying these three elements in the serialized object gives us the ability to:\n\nCreate files wherever we have permission on the system. The caveat here is that we only have control of the file path and not the final filename.\nCopy the contents of files from one file on the system to a location we specify (again we only control the directory path and not the filename). This will also attempt to delete the file we copy from.. so be careful."

I just noticed today that anyone, regardless of how the Roles are set up or if one is even signed in, can click the button and resume a build. This has the potential to cause unstable environments if someone realizes that and continues to rebuild the failed build to get what they want built. I know I am a little behind on the role strategy plugin but I don't think that's where the issue is coming from. It seems to me that the resume build button doesn't take into account who actually has access to run the build in the first place. \r\n\r\nWe have it set up to where one can browse the build logs of Jenkins without needing to be logged in. I don't really see that as being an issue since we send out the job url's to many groups so the can check on the stauts of the build. And subsequently look at the console output if there is a failure. I have attached a resumed build showing that it was started by an anonymous user. In the role for 'anonymous' users, they are only given read access. I have also tested this with a logged in user that does not have the access to build the original job.

This is because the LDAP requires the password to be nonempty for simple authentication. The protocol automatically converts the authentication to \"none\" if a password is not supplied.\u201d\n \nSince the LdapAuthenticationProviderImpl.Authenticate method is relying on a NamingException being thrown during creation of initial context, it does not fail when the context result is an \u201cunauthenticated\u201d positive response from the LDAP server.

The service expects me to include a valid deflate encoded (compressed) then base 64 encoded token in the Authorization of my RESTful call like this:\n\nSAML <TOKEN GOES HERE>\n\nHowever if instead of inserting a token, I insert the following string \"invalid_grant\" in the Authrorization header like so:\n\nSAML invalid_grant\n\nThe following will happen:\n1. SamlHeaderInHandler splits the header into it's two parts and sends what it thinks is the assertion (the \"invalid_grant\" string) AbstractSamlBase64InHandler.handleToken\n2. AbstractSamlBase64InHandler.handleToken first base 64 decodes the string. This completes with no error.\n3. AbstractSamlBase64InHandler.handleToken then tries to inflate the assertion.\n\nIt is during this last step that CXF goes into an infinite loop. Here is the code involved:\n\n        while (!inflater.finished()) {\n            inputLen = inflater.inflate(input);\n            if (!inflater.finished()) {\n                inflatedToken = new byte[input.length + inflatedLen];\n                System.arraycopy(input, 0, inflatedToken, inflatedLen, inputLen);\n                inflatedLen += inputLen;\n            }\n        }\n\nWhen the input is the following byte array:\n\n[94, -27, -122, 110, 16, 59, 41, 43, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n(which is the result from base 64 decoding the string \"invalid_grant\")\n\nThe loop never breaks because the test inflater.finished() is never true even if inputLen is 0. Thus the service hangs indefinitely.\n\nI am classifying this as Critical because, essentially, by crafting a certain type of request, I can execute a denial of service attack against the service.\n\n"

Instead the implementation uses the length of the key to be generated (e.g. 1024 Bit), but FIPS 186-4, Table C.3 makes a statement about the length of the prime factors p and q.

The latter has its own bind method which does not check the password length. If the directory allows anonymous binds (I'm not sure whether this is an issue with AD), then it may incorrectly authenticate a user who supplies an empty password.\n\nThe password length check should be moved to AbstractLdapAuthenticationProvide.authenticate."

If 512 MB is multiplied with 4 it comes to an overflow: 512*1024*1024 << 2 = -2147483648, which is Integer.MIN_VALUE.\nOne solution would be to change the used types from int to long.\n\nIf we stay with datatype int, we could improve the implementation:\nwhile (newPos > newSize) {\n \tnewSize = (newSize < (512*1024*1024)) ?

exploitation of memory for an attacker super easy Consider following script script function asm js module use function asm js function attacker code return asm js function create 0x1000 executable our

executable PAGE EXECUTE READ with which An attacker can request one module many times which to the creation of many Due to the allocation granularity of he can then choose a fixed address such as 0x1c1c0000 and can be certain that his code is there following are responsible that spray is possible Some of them are well known Not MANY but only ONE region should be per module Many to one module should return instead of new Constant folding is missing in Release But it it was added in Nightly between and This it possible to use many subsequent arithmetic on one variable and wrap the legitimate For example we can hide three 0x90 in with 0xA8909090 0xA8909090 Following native code is 05909090A8 ADD 0xA8909090 05909090A8 ADD 0xA8909090 When we jump into offset the immediate of the first instruction we can execute our hidden code We use 0xA8 as A805 TEST AL A8 Although constant to be in Nightly an attacker can still force to emit his hidden code for example he can hide two and a jump to the next constant with following code asm js heap 0x10 0xEB069090 asm js heap 0x11 0xEB069090 following native code B89090EB06 0x06EB9090 A340C07B04 0x047BC040 0A B89090EB06 0x06EB9090 0F A344C07B04 0x047BC044 But when we jump into offset we get EB06 0x0B 0B 0C 0D EB06 0x15 Another possibility is to use and pass many to it Consider following code heap 0x90909090 0x90909090 0x90909090 0x90909090 and many more Following native code is Nightly 0a1 bit u 1c1c0053 1c1c0053 1c1c0054 1c1c0055 1c1c0056 c744240c90909090 0Ch 90909090h 1c1c005e c744241090909090 10h 90909090h 1c1c0066

blinding of Hence an attacker can use the well known trick to hide his within the as shown in There is insufficient random insertion It that the same amount and type of are for a specific module That that the native code of one module is fully predictable An attacker can test his code and use it across other with the same version am I missing here Better random insertion would break More random base each time the same module is used would help too Separating code from data such as a constant pool for might also help To demonstrate that this spray works I attached several proof of for and an exploit for a mitre name a the recent Tor Browser 0day I have also for a mitre name a and a mitre name a but the attached should proof the point Information how to test them is available in the Principally spray should work for too However on a granularity hence more need to be to occupy a predictable address I did not investigate any for bit However it might also be affected in one or

directory and will default to C Program x86 if not One of the on a small race condition which always executed in less than a minute for me but let me know if you have any It will continue trying until it or you use c to kill it The included just foo which should create a foo file in your drive root with the contents in execution of arbitrary absolute The entry in the C Program x86 file is executed by the after a successful action is made There are made to prevent directory traversal however if an absolute file path is provided instead of a then which will return the absolute file path instead C Program x86 C C The will happily execute this file as long as it is by with a current certificate We can use then use these in ways never intended to gain arbitrary code execution The avenue used in this proof of concept is to use the setup to install into an attacker directory which then whatever is in the maintenanceservice installer file on post install in fairness this would have no practical chance of being otherwise I imagine there are similar in other however I have not them Arbitrary file overwrite with partial content injection Soon after the which with the attacker patch directory to get a temp for the log file By providing a file which with will just copy the input into the output buffer instead of providing a valid temp directory c L log c Since it is essentially a normal file path the log file will happily truncate and write to this file We can insert up to at some point in the file the fact that the working directory argument logged in The resulting file up looking something like the following s are user a replace request PATCH DIRECTORY C INSTALLATION DIRECTORY C Program x86 WORKING DIRECTORY The apply to directory must be the same as or a child of the installation directory In order to reach the line of code which the working directory argument we need to first avoid a failure of otherwise the will exit early and we will only truncate the file without our content written The reason is that it to move a file to patch update status which in this case is c status which is not possible because file is a file However if we create a directory junction in an attacker directory c pointing to c target then we can supply that to the instead Now after the a file to file we race it to switch the junction out with a directory file before it the status file move If we win the race the c status and execution Arbitrary code execution Because t very picky about the of the we can use the arbitrary file overwrite to replace the C Program x86 with one which like this a replace request PATCH DIRECTORY C INSTALLATION DIRECTORY C Program x86 WORKING DIRECTORY C dirff setup C dirff setup The apply to directory must be the same as or a child of the installation directory The ff setup the entry set to an attacker directory c and the entry set to true The attacker just needs to copy their into c exploit new firefoxmaintenanceservice installer and keep it locked for so it can t be on install but can be executed Then we trigger some action which will succeed like staging an mar file which will execute the command which will install a new copy of into the attacker c directory which will then run the maintenanceservice install as SYSTEM Let me know if you need any more information I tested on x64 a archive orgpubfirefoxreleases51 1updatewin32en
